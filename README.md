## A3 Task Manager

your glitch (or alternative server) link e.g. http://a3-charlie-roberts.glitch.me

Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

- the goal of the application
- challenges you faced in realizing the application
- what authentication strategy you chose to use and why (choosing one because it seemed the easiest to implement is perfectly acceptable)
- what CSS framework you used and why
  - include any modifications to the CSS framework you made via custom CSS you authored
- the five Express middleware packages you used and a short (one sentence) summary of what each one does. If you use a custom function for *one* (and one alone) middleware please 
add a little more detail about what it does.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I got 100% on all four lighthouse tests

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I followed the following 12 tips from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative
  1. Provided unique & informative page titles: All of my pages have unique titles that describe their purpose
  2. Use headings to convey meaning and structure: My sections have headings that describe the section
  3. Make link text meaningful: All of the buttons have descriptions
  4. Provided clear instructions
  5. Kept content clear and concise
  6. Ensure that interactive elements are easy to identify: I made sure that the buttons were darker than the background, so they would stand out
  7. I provided clear and consistent navigation options to navigate to the login page and the account creation page
  8. Ensure that form elements include clearly associated labels: My 'Add Task Form', 'Edit Task Form', 'Login Form', and 'Account Creation Form' have labels for every input
  9. Used headings and spacing to group related content, such as the 'Add Task Form' and the task list
  10. Donâ€™t use color alone to convey information: While I use color, I also use text to convey information 
  11. Provide sufficient contrast between foreground and background: To accomplish this, I used a dark blue background which contrasts well with white text
  12. Identify page language and language changes: I indicated the primary language as english on each page
